This project is originally created by GI1MIC found at https://github.com/gi1mic/19Dollar-DSP-Filter
I am modifying it to fit inside of an Icom IC-706MKIIG and controlled by listening to the outgoing Ci-V bus.
Plan is also to be able to change settings by applying proprietary commands over Ci-V from an external PC.
